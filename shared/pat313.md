#### by Nigel Baillie

???

My choice piece of music is called "Vignette Visions".

It is composed by a guy who goes by "Disasterpeace".

"Vignette: Visions" is for a game called Hyper Light Drifter.

It plays during the opening cinematic.

Disasterpeace composed the whole soundtrack, so "Vignette: Visions" is pretty representative of the stuff you hear throughout the game.

# Stuff to think about

- Retro-style game, but no old console samples - does it fit?
???
You can see that Hyper Light Drifter has retro-style pixel-art graphics.

Most games with that style of graphics will sample old console sounds
for their music, as sort of a direct omage to the same technology that
inspired their graphics.

Hyper Light Drifter doesn't seem to take that approach. As far as I can tell,
Disasterpeace does not sample any old console sounds.

- Lots of subtractive synthesis and filtering/compression
???
----
Instead, Disasterpeace seems to use a lot of subtractive synthesis
and filtering techniques.

In some cases I *think* it is using heavily altered accoustic instrument sounds.

I'd be interested to hear if you guys think it still fits the visual style.

- How would it work with real instruments?
???
----
Another interesting thing about the Hyper Light Drifter soundtrack, and
*Vignette: Visions* in particular, is that it's composed in a way that might
work with accoustic instruments.

What I mean by that is, you might be able to imagine a version of "Vignette: Visions"
played by a live orchestra or something.

While listening, try to identify what kinds of instruments the piece
could be made up of.

- Focus on volume/dynamics
???
----
One more thing that's very apparent in this piece is its use of dynamics.

The song goes very quiet and very loud. Think about how that might enhance the cinematic.

# Thoughts?

Does the soundscape fit the aesthetic?

How did dynamics effect the experience?

Do you think there are any real-world samples in the piece?

Could this be "re-orchestrated" to use only accoustic instruments?

???
Anything come to mind?

How would an accoustic-only arrangement sound? Would it still fit?

# Waveform!

I thought the waveform was pretty interesting to look at.

It really shows off the extreme jumps in amplitude throughout the piece.

These are some small snippets showcasing some sounds that I think seem
at least vaguely similar to "real" instruments.

How do you guys think these sounds were created?

Kind of holds song form.
