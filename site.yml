      - My entry for Ludum Dare 30. This was my first Ludum Dare entry, and probably
        my first ever full game. I had done game development before this but never
        actually finished anything. I suppose the 48 hour time limit pushed me over
        the edge.
      - The game is mostly just black and white. There is a black character, and a white character.
        The black character only collides with black shapes and vice versa. The fun part is that,
        for instance, a black shape can overlap another black shape, creating a new opening for the
        white character to jump into.

      - My entry for Ludum Dare 31, my second Ludum Dare. I originally described this one as
        "a mix between Tetris and Minecraft". Blocks fall from the sky, and the goal is just to
        punch them. If a block lands on you while you're not either dodging or jumping, you are
        crushed and it's game over. Some blocks shoot projectiles, some explode, and some contain
        a powerup that can help you clear large stacks of blocks. Eventually, a black hole appears,
        stirring the madness.
      - 'This one turned out rather fun, I think. It got rated #90 in the "fun" category for LD31.'

      - My entry for Ludum Dare 33. The theme for that LD was "You are the Monster", which I had
        a hard time working with. I came up with the idea of having an enemy that mimicks the player's
        behavior somehow, which I thought was a neat, somewhat literal interpretation of
        "You are the Monster".
      - I figured if I was going to base the game off of enemy behavior,
        I'd need to have a reasonably complex combat system. I came up with something that's vaguely
        similar to Crypt of The NecroDancer, except with a sidescroller view (and the camera does
        not move). Pressing an arrow key moves the character one cell in the specified direction. The "up"
        direction does somewhat of a jump where the character moves up one cell, and then down one cell after
        a delay. When the player jumps, and then presses the left or right arrow key while still in the air,
        they perform a downward slash in that direction. Pressing the down button blocks incoming attacks.
      - The goal of the game is to move onto your opponent's cell. When each player moves onto each other's
        cell simultaneously, it's a "clash" and no movement happens. It's a weird system, but surprisingly
        easy to get the hang of. I did eventually create a boss enemy that behaves differently based on
        the player's actions during the first several fights, but it was honestly not obvious at all, so
        nobody really understood the connection between this game and the theme. Nevertheless, the game
        ranked number 36 in "fun" and 58 in "overall".
